# CS Theory Notes by Akshansh

Welcome to my personal knowledge repository focused on theoretical understanding of core computer science and programming concepts. These notes are designed to explain the "why" behind the "what" â€” covering intuition, memory models, analogies, and system-level behavior.

ðŸ“š Topics include:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Java Core + Web
- Memory and Runtime Behavior
- Visual Explanations and Diagrams

This repository serves as a living document â€” Iâ€™ll keep updating it as my understanding evolves. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
